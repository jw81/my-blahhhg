If you're reading this, you're either Jeffrey Wallace (that's me) or you've probably taken a wrong turn somewhere on the interwebs.  🥴

While you're here, feel free to read my ramblings.  My plan is to use this as some kind of Today-I-Learned📚 kinda thing for any interesting programming 💻 stuff that I run into.  Who knows, I might also write about non-programming stuff.  Like my adventures in raising kids and chickens. 👧👦🐓🐓

Anyway, take a look around if ya want, or don't, whatever. 👋😎
